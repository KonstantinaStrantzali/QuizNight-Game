The Quiz Night Game is a fun quiz game. The game objective is to answer in 10 question before the time runs out. This game is a great brain training tool, which can help the user to improve or test their general knowledge and get better at trivia while having fun. 

The Quiz Night Game website consists of three webpages and one modal created using [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), 
[CSS3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), the library [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), 
the JavaScript library [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).  This project is part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at the [Code Institue](https://codeinstitute.net/) and was created to practically show  my learning and understanding of the Interactive Frontend Development module.
